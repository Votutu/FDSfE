Doing this assignment, I worked with Ite and Chinyere to come up with a solution to the problem. It was very infornative, and I learnt how to find the mean and standard 
deviation using describe(). I contributed in the way that I could, but I mostly listened to the explanations Of Ite and Chinyere together with watching the videos of the 
previous zoom meetings.
